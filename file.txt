Section 1 
Biodiversity, the variety of life on Earth, plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems.
 It encompasses the diversity of species, genetic variations, and the complex interactions among organisms.
 Healthy ecosystems, rich in biodiversity, provide essential services such as clean air and water, pollination
 of crops, and regulation of climate. These services are vital for human survival and well-being, making 
 biodiversity conservation a global priority.
